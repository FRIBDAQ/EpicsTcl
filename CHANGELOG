March 22, 2007 - Use CChannelVariable derived from CTCLVariable so that
                 epics linked variables are bi-directional.
               - Formally set release level to 1.2
               - Manage duplicate channel definitions by using reference counted
                 channels.
March 26, 2007 - Correct docs for epicsTypeNGo - It should be used as
		 controlwidget::epicsTypNGo
               - Correct docs for meter widget.. in some cases the
	         phrase 'meter height' is more appropriately 
	         meter indicator height.
               - Support mult-way links of epics PV's to tcl variables.
               - support epicschannel listlinks subcommand.

                 window even on Weird-ass MAC's for the meter widget.
March 27, 2007 - Implement epicsMeter widget.  This widget provides a meter
                 for any epics channel .. not just a BCM.
               - Supply a controlwidget::epicsBCMMeter alias to 
	         controlwidget::bcmMeter to match the normal epics naming 
                 scheme
               - Correct epics.xml so that:
                 o first example uses a label not an entry.
                 o plug the use of the epics widgets rather than
                   roll your own.
                 o Build epicsStripChart widget.. need docs.

               - Fix bindDown typo in led.
               - Hunt for tcl development stuff in /opt/local/{include,lib}
                 where the OS-X darwin ports put it.. that's the preferred
                 tcl/tk version for us since it supports a good BLT.
               - Add epicsStripChart documentation.
March 29, 2007 - Remove last debugging outputs from epicsStripChart.tcl
               - Add examples to the epicsStripChart docs.
