March 22, 2007 - Use CChannelVariable derived from CTCLVariable so that
                 epics linked variables are bi-directional.
               - Formally set release level to 1.2
               - Manage duplicate channel definitions by using reference counted
                 channels.
March 26, 2007 - Correct docs for epicsTypeNGo - It should be used as
		 controlwidget::epicsTypNGo
               - Correct docs for meter widget.. in some cases the
	         phrase 'meter height' is more appropriately 
	         meter indicator height.
               - Support mult-way links of epics PV's to tcl variables.
               - support epicschannel listlinks subcommand.
               - First shot at measuring text so it will fit inside the
                 window even on Weird-ass MAC's for the meter widget.
March 27, 2007 - Implement epicsMeter widget.  This widget provides a meter
                 for any epics channel .. not just a BCM.
               - Supply a controlwidget::epicsBCMMeter alias to 
	         controlwidget::bcmMeter to match the normal epics naming 
                 scheme
               - Correct epics.xml so that:
                 o first example uses a label not an entry.
                 o plug the use of the epics widgets rather than
                   roll your own.
                 o Build epicsStripChart widget.. need docs.
March 28, 2007 - Fix timebase error in stripchart.
               - Fix bindDown typo in led.
               - Hunt for tcl development stuff in /opt/local/{include,lib}
                 where the OS-X darwin ports put it.. that's the preferred
                 tcl/tk version for us since it supports a good BLT.
               - Add epicsStripChart documentation.
March 29, 2007 - Remove last debugging outputs from epicsStripChart.tcl
               - Add examples to the epicsStripChart docs.  
   	       - Remove empty doc file ClanguageTraceCallbacks.xml
               - set configure.in to 1.2-pre1  will be final when
  		 Skip's shopping list is completely implemented.
April 24, 2007 - Added epicsGraph widget.. This is the x/y plot widget
                 on Skip's shopping list for epics widgets.
April 25, 2007 - Add stuff needed to build windows targets.
               - Added docs for epicsGraph widget.
April 26, 2007 - Ensure that the windows port still compiles/works
                 on linux
	       - Add a sample application to the epicsgraph manpage.
June 5, 2007   - Use a per channel semaphore to ensure that data structures
                 in the channel are appropriately synchonized between 
                 epics and application threads (notifications can be
                 in an arbitrary thread).
               - Ensure that Tcl calls triggered by a notification
                 are done by posting events to the Tcl interpreter so that
                 they get done in the contex of the Tcl thread rather than
                 violating the Tcl apartment model of threading.
               - In epicsStripChart.tcl:
                 o Use a more efficient way to trim back the history lists.
                 o Do timing based on an absolute time offset relative to the
                   start time and timebase rather than accumulating times and
                   hence errors in the offsets.
               - Document the need to define LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.9
                 for some linux systems.
  	       - Deal with some timing holes revolving around channel deletion:
                 o Don't allow channel command update handlers to run on 
                   channel commands that were destroyed.
                 o When channels are deleted prior to being connected, 
                   change their connection handlers to something safe and
                   null so that update handlers won't get established if they
                   get connected in the timing hole between object deletion
                   and epics channel run-down.
Release 1.3   Released June 6, 2007

Release 1.3-001
	- Fix potential compute bound deadlock with circular traces when the
          same tcl variable is bound more than once to a channel >and<
          that channel shows a high rate of change.
        - Deployed June 15, 2007.

Release 1.3.002
- BZ302 - Ensure that label options can propagate to the underlying label
          widgets for both epicsLabel and epicsLabelWithUnits.
